A quote of the day generator that returns a random quote from the array of quotes. Used multiple functions, that do one specific thing only to make the code more readable and easier to maintain / extend. Used modules to complete the task of importing the quotes into the main javascript file. The user is able to click a "Random Quote" button to generate one of the quotes.
